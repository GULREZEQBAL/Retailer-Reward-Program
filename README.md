# Retailer Reward Program

## Introduction

Welcome to the Retailer Reward Program web application! This application is designed to help you track and manage customer reward points based on their transactions. It provides a clear overview of transaction history, individual customer rewards, and overall reward statistics.

## Accessing the Application

You can access the application by visiting https://github.com/GULREZEQBAL/Retail-Rewards-App in your web browser.

## Setup (General - For Development)

This project was built using React and set up with Create React App. To run this project locally for development, follow these steps:

1.  **Prerequisites:** Make sure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your machine. You can download Node.js from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/). npm usually comes bundled with Node.js. If you prefer yarn, you can install it globally using `npm install --global yarn`.
2.  **Clone the Repository:** If you haven't already, clone the project repository to your local machine using Git.
3.  **Install Dependencies:** Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run either:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```
    This will install all the necessary dependencies listed in the `package.json` file.
4.  **Start the Application:** Once the dependencies are installed, run either:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    yarn start
    ```
    This will start the development server, and the application should open automatically in your web browser (usually at `http://localhost:3000`).

## Key Features
